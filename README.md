# 🧠 The Smartest Desktop Agent

An AI-powered desktop agent that lives as a floating widget on your screen and expands into a powerful chatbot when clicked. Like Google’s Project Astra, but made for your desktop — it understands your real-time context across applications like Chrome, PDF viewers, Office apps, and more.

No need to upload files, take screenshots, or switch tabs. Just ask your question, and Dekstop assistant will gives instant answers or performs actions — **right where you are**.
